					<h4>ABOUT ME</h4>

					<p>I am a recent graduate of the Epicodus Bootcamp in Portland Oregon where I developed full stack web development skills in C#/.NET, Ruby/Rails and React.js/React Native. At this bootcamp I built a multitude of full stack programs both independently and with teams including weekly projects and larger, longer-term projects. I had weekly code challenges to test my abilities. I am at the point where I am able to independently build a Web App front and back end with a custom API and full unit testing in C#/.NET, Ruby on Rails, or Javascript with React.</p>

						<p>My background is in social sciences and social work, which means I bring with me a deep understanding of working with large data sets, the importance of security and protecting information and knowledge of web accessibility tool and other technologies that people who experience certain disabilities use to access the web and other media. I also have experience managing a large caseload of up to 90 clients, which taught me time management, the importance of documentation and communication, the value of peer consultation and an understanding of personal accountability for the work I produce.</p>
						
						<p>I decided to make the career shift to the tech industry through many close friends who work in the field in various roles, including Product Owner, Scrum Master, Lead Developer, QA testing and UX/UI. I learned front end development independently and Python before I decided to make the investment in a Full Stack Development Boot Camp.</p>
						
						<p>I am looking to find a job at a company I can really invest time and effort in because the company is willing to invest in my growth as a professional. I am flexible and very ready to integrate my skills and knowledge with the needs of my employer and my team.</p>
						
						<p>I have experience working both in person and remotely in a full-time capacity and am happy to accept either type of position. For the right employer I would be willing to relocate and am willing to travel for training and other work purposes.</p>
